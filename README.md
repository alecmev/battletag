# Battletag

A cross-browser extension for
[Battlefield 4™ Battlelog™](http://help.ea.com/en/article/what-is-battlelog/).
Displays your current clan tag on every server join button. A right click opens
a menu, where you can either type in a new tag, or just select a platoon you
want to represent - both your tag and emblem will be updated accordingly, and
the platoon will be set as active.
